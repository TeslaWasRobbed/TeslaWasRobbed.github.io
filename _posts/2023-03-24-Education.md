## Cardiff Metropolitan University
I am currently a student at Cardiff Metropolitan University studying BSc (Hons) Cyber Security. I have been studying the course for two years and have found it to be very interesting and rewarding. The course is split into three years, each year containing six modules. The modules are as follows:

### Year one
    Computational Thinking
    Architecture and Operating Systems
    Developing Quality Software

### Year two

I have completed a variety of assessments, class tests and group work during my stuides and have found the experience to be very rewarding. I am eager to apply my knowledge to real world scenarios and have to develop my skills in a number of areas.
