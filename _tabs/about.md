# About Me

Hi there! My name is Nathan and I'm currently a cyber security student. I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. Cyber security is a fascinating field to me because it combines my love for technology with the need to protect sensitive information from malicious actors.
Education

I am currently pursuing a degree in cyber security from Cardiff Metropolitan University. Through my coursework, I have gained a solid foundation in topics such as network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking. I am also working on several projects outside of my coursework to further develop my skills and knowledge.
Experience

Here are some of the skills I have developed through my studies and experience:

    Network security
    Cryptography
    Ethical hacking
    Vulnerability assessment
    Risk management
    Incident response
    Programming languages (e.g. Python, Java)
    Operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux)
    

# Interests

When I'm not studying or working on cyber security projects, I enjoy reading, video games and cooking. I believe that having a balance between work and play is important for maintaining productivity and creativity.
